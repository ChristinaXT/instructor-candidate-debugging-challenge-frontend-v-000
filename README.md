# JavaScript Debugging Challenge

This challenge is meant to test an applicant's ability to help a student debug a vanilla JavaScript application. Type of bugs include: DOM manipulation, DOM events, typos, scoping, user interaction.

## Student background

The student is in their seventh week of the program and has been exposed to:

* HTML,
* CSS,
* procedural JavaScript,
* DOM manipulation,
* DOM events,
* Promises, and
* XHR/fetch requests


## Deliverables

1. As a user, I can create a gravatar based on a phrase
2. As a user, I can add a comment to the gravatar
3. As a user, I can add another comment without clearing the input

## First issue

I'm building an app that allows a user to type in a phrase and get a pixelated image generated for it. Once an image is generated, the user should be able to add a comment to it and the comment should render below the image.

The problem that I'm running into is that I can't seem to submit the comment form for the image. The code to create the image and the code to add a comment works, but the comment form always refreshes the page.
