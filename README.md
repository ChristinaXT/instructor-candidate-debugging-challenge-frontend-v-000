# Instructor Candidate Debugging Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to imitate a student/teacher interaction for an instructor candidate. The setting is as follows: the "student" brings some code they are working on to the "instructor", who will go through various errors to help the student achieve some desired functionality. In this case, the student is trying to implement a `POST` request on an api (you'll want to look at/run the [Backend Repo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/instructor-candidate-debugging-challenge-backend)) which loads comments for the student's pre-existing [Gravatar Generator](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/js-gravatar-creator).

You can find a fully functional version of the app in the `solution` branch. However, we want the candidate to go through the following steps to help the student create a functional comment form.
